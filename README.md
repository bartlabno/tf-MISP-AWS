# Terraform MISP
Terraform stack for the MISP infrastructure.

## What is MISP
MISP, formerly Malware Information Sharing Platform and now known as the Open Source Threat Sharing Platform, is a powerful open source threat intelligence platform organisations can use to store, share and receive information about malware, threats, and vulnerabilities in a structured way.

## MISP on the Docker
MISP container (Docker) image focused on high performance and security based on AlmaLinux, ready for production.

This image contains the latest version of MISP and the required dependencies. Image is intended as immutable, which means that it is not possible to update MISP from the user interface and instead, an admin should download a newer image.

# Schema
![MISP schema](./MISP_schema.png)

## AWS Setup
AWS Setup is based on private and public VPCs handling frontend and backend setup.
- Github Actions is used for deployments, maintenance (image updates, task definition updates)
- When quering [misp url](misp.example.com) you are facing Internet Gateways allowing traffic to the LoadBalancers and ECS Service
- Route53 is forwarding traffic to the Load Balancer
- Load Balancer is routing traffic to the ECS Service (MISP)
- MISP service is being managed by task definitions. These contains all important variables. It also pulls secrets from Secret Manager - for databe connectivity, SALT SHAs and other sensitive information
- MISP containers are being checked before updated into our ECR registry. Once new revision added Task Definition is being updated and ECS Service is updating to the latest stable and approved version
- ECS Service is connecting to the Redis which caches some requests and stores copy of feeds locally. These are being updated every hour
- ECS Service is also connecting to the database, storing feeds, further configuration, user base, etc
- ECS is connecting to the AWS SES which is sending emails when required
